* Employee Name - Enter the name of the employee that this time sheet is for. This will autocomplete. Upon selecting a name from the auto complete, the Employee Number is auto filled. You must select a name from the autocomplete list. Failure to do so will result in an error upon form submission

If there are any exceptions to this please enter `See Notes` and enter further details in the notes section. Leave this blank if you are not claiming.

Upon completion of the form, please click the `Submit` button to upload the form. A success notification will appear.

Below the form are two additional buttons. `Copy` and `Clear`. The `Copy` button will populate the form with the data last uploaded by you. This makes filling out the form for multiple days or people much faster. The `Clear` button resets the form back to its default values.

#### Recent Uploads Table
Upon uploading a time sheet, it will appear in the table at the bottom of the screen. This allows you to check it has been uploaded correctly. If you notice any errors, you can click the delete icon at the far end of the row, to delete that entry, or the edit button to fix the errors. The edit button loads that timesheet back into the form allowing you to fix any errors.
