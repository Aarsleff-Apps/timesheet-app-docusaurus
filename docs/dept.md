## What Job No. Do I Use?
For most jobs you will be given the job or contract number.  If in doubt, ask your line manager what job your work needs to be coded to.  When you start to type in the number, it will bring up a list, and you must actively select from that list.

However, for some more general tasks, there are some miscellaneous codes which you will need to know.

For Site operatives, this will mostly be 30000.  If you start to type 30000, you will get a drop down list and you should choose the most appropriate description.

Here are some hints for using 30000:

### 30000 – Training
Select 30000 – Training, and fill in the rest of the timesheet as you would for any other job.  In notes, put what you were doing eg Asbestos training.

### 30000 – Yard
Select 30000 – Yard, and fill in the rest of the timesheet as you would for any other job.  Then in the notes put whether Newark or Doncaster yard and what you were doing, eg which rig you were unloading.

### 30000 – Office
Select 30000 – Office, and fill in the rest of the timesheet as you would for any other job.

### 30000 – Standby (In House)
Select 30000 – Standby.  Put in Start Time and End Time to give 8 hours Mon – Thurs or 7 hours Friday (eg Monday 08:00 to 16:00).  Use 0 for the break.  Select your home department and submit.

### 30000 – Other (Holiday, Sick etc)
Use this for holidays, sick, unpaid leave or other absences eg Paternity Leave, as well as any jobs that don’t fit into the categories above.

For Holiday and sick, just put 0 in the Start Time, End Time and Break, then select the correct reason in the Absent drop down list, choose your department and submit.

If you are going on holiday, you can submit your holiday timesheet before you go, but you must still go through the usual procedure of filling in a holiday form and getting it signed by your line manager.

If you are off sick, then you must still contact your line manager in accordance with your Terms and Conditions of Employment, and produce a Fit Note or Self-Certification document as normal.

### 40999 - External Hire
If you are working on an external hire, eg for Junttan or Northern Piling, then all hours need to go to 40999.  You will need to select Plant as the department.

### Working on a rig
If you are working for the Plant Department on a specific rig, eg doing the maintenance, then type 40 into the Job No and a list of rigs will be shown.  Select the correct rig, and make sure the department is Plant.

## What Department Do I Choose?
You will normally work in your own department, Piling, Beams, Geo, SRW or Plant.  If you are on loan to another department, you must choose the loan department.  This is because when you choose the department, the system automatically sends your timesheet to that department’s authoriser.  If it does not go to the correct person, it may not get authorised in time for payroll!

If you are on standby, holiday, sick or absent for any other reason, then use your home department, even if you were on loan to a different department for the rest of the week.

If you are in any doubt, please ask your line manager.
